Your Twitter Network: OSCON 2014 Puzzle
=======================================

[Co-occurrence networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence_networks)
are often used to infer social networks from mentions of names in a set of
documents. This Scala coding puzzle invites you to create a co-occurrence
network from your personal Twitter archive, and to discover some facts about the
Twitter users in that network, including which have the highest
[degree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28graph_theory%29),
[node strength](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_network), and (for extra
credit)
[centrality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_centrality#Degree_centrality).

We provide a sample archive together with correct output, and will be
evaluating submissions against [@TwitterOSS](https://twitter.com/TwitterOSS)'s
tweets, but we encourage you to download your own archive for development.

The puzzle should take between 15 minutes and an hour, with the two extra
credit questions possibly requiring a little more time and thought.
